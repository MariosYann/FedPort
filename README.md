# FedPort
Service and data portability for federated and self-hosted systems.

FedPort is an open-source service and data portability toolkit designed for federated and self-hosted services within the NixOS and Fediversity ecosystem.
The project aims to decouple user data from online services by providing a universal, open data model and a modular adapter-based architecture for exporting, transforming, and importing data across platforms.
FedPort focuses on reproducibility, interoperability, and user control, and is packaged for NixOS to enable reliable and declarative deployment.
This repository contains early-stage research and development work and serves as the public code and documentation space for the FedPort project.
